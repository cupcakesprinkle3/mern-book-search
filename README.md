# Book Search Engine

## Project Motivation

As part of the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, we refactored a RESTful API to make use of GraphQL and Apollo. The backend is to be modified to use Apollo Server, JWT, typDefs, and resolvers. The front end is to be modified to include client side query and mutation files to use those queries and mutations in the client side page files. 

## Tech Used
Mongo/Mongoose, Express, React, Node ... as well as Apollo Client/Server.

## Deployed App
https://dry-dawn-34153.herokuapp.com/ (sadly not functioning yet)

## Screenshot
(from local environment, which does start server and client before erroring out on book save)
